# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio where I share the projects I’m building and the things I’m learning along the way.
It’s a small space to track my growth, experiment with ideas, and slowly get better at building for the web.

## About
I’m currently learning and exploring frontend development.  
This portfolio is a reflection of that journey — not a finished product, but something that evolves as I do.
